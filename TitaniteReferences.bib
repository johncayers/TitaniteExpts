abstract = {Combined Sm-Nd and U-Pb isotopic systems in single titanite grains from Archean rocks may be used to obtain Nd isotope composition at the time of titanite growth. The closed Sm-Nd system requirement is applied to titanite, and its integrity is monitored using the U-Pb system, in a similar way as U-Pb in zircon is used to interpret Lu-Hf data. The Nd isotope composition at the time of titanite formation can be used to infer initial Nd isotopic values of the rocks at the time of zircon crystallization. This approach does not involve assumption that the Sm-Nd system in the rocks remained closed since their formation, whereas such assumption underlies all initial Nd determinations based on whole rock analyses. Titanite is a common accessory mineral in felsic rocks and a major concentrator of REE and uranium. Titanite populations are in many cases heterogeneous, and resolving the isotopic characteristics of old and young titanite populations requires isotopic analysis of multiple single grains. Here I report Sm-Nd and U-Pb data from single titanite grains from four early Archean gneisses previously studied for Lu-Hf and U-Pb systematics of zircon. Gneisses from the Isua area contain heterogeneous populations of titanite, which form roughly linear arrays in the U-Pb concordia diagram, with ca. 3600 Ma upper intercepts, and ca. 2600-2700 Ma lower intercepts, or contain individual concordant grains of the latter age. Two of these gneisses also contain titanite grains of a high-U variety, which plot below these discordia lines, probably as a result of post-Archean loss of radiogenic Pb. Titanite from a gneiss from the Nuuk area is concordant at 2520-2600 Ma. Sm-Nd analyses of several single titanite grains from the Isua area gneiss GGU163263 yielded an isochron age of 3555 ± 150 Ma, identical to the upper intercept U-Pb age of 3601 ± 15 Ma. The [epsilon]Nd(Ttit) values of these grains, calculated using their 207Pb/206Pb ages, are uniform for the oldest titanite fractions with Nd content {\textgreater} 1000 ppm, and give the average [epsilon]Nd(Ttit) = + 0.32 ± 0.20 at 3601 Ma. Extrapolation from this value to 3708 ± 25 Ma, an average of the ages of two zircon populations, using an average crustal 147Sm/144Nd = 0.12 ± 0.04 yields [epsilon]Nd(Tzir) = + 1.4 ± 0.6 at the time of crystallization. Zircon from the same rock has average [epsilon]Hf(Tzir) = + 1.9 ± 1.0. Titanite grains from two other gneisses from the Isua area show more complex Sm-Nd patterns. Predominant pale-brown to colorless populations have variable 147Sm/144Nd ratios reaching as high as 0.7, and do not form isochrons, suggesting that recrystallization of titanite was possibly accompanied by modification of the Sm-Nd system in the whole rock. No reliable initial Nd value has been obtained from these gneisses. The Sm-Nd analyses of titanite fractions from the gneiss from the Nuuk area yielded an average [epsilon]Nd(T) = - 9.00 ± 0.37. Extrapolation to the zircon crystallization age of 3610 ± 10 Ma yields an [epsilon]Nd(T) value of + 1.8 ± 5.4, which has low precision due to extrapolation over a billion-year period. The results presented here show that precise and tenable initial Nd values for early Archean gneisses can be obtained from analyses of best preserved titanite grains in favorable cases, even if these grains represent a small fraction of an otherwise young or altered titanite population.},

abstract = {Evolved magmas, including highly explosive rhyolites, are mainly generated by extraction of viscous melts from solid residues either in (1) partial melting zones within the crust (dominantly up-temperature evolution with newly formed silicic melt), or in (2) long-lived crystallizing mush zones fed by mafic to intermediate magmas (dominantly down-temperature evolution with residual silicic melt). Although both processes undoubtedly occur and are generally coupled, allowing for mixing between mantle and crustal components, we argue that combined field, thermal, geochemical, and geophysical observations favor residual melt extraction from crystalline mushes as the likely scenario in all tectonic settings. Depending on the main melting process in the mantle, two end-member differentiation trends occur: (1) a dry lineage leading to hot-reduced rhyolites and granites in magmatic provinces fueled by decompression melting of the mantle; (2) a wet lineage leading to cold-oxidized rhyolites and granites in subduction zones dominated by flux melting of the mantle.},

abstract = {An extensive electron microprobe survey of amphibole compositions in the Fish Canyon magma (2146 analyses), more than 80{\%} of which are from high-resolution ({\textless}10 $\mu$m steps) core-to-rim traverses across large euhedral phenocrysts, provides: (1) temporal constraints on the immediately pre-eruptive P-T-fH2O evolution of the magma, and (2) a means of evaluating recent calibrations of the Al-in-hornblende barometer (Anderson and Smith 1995; hereafter AS1995) and thermometers (Blundy and Holland 1990; thermometers A and B of Holland and Blundy 1994; hereafter BH1990, HB1994TA, and HB1994TB).Hornblende phenocrysts are variable for most major elements (e.g., 5–9 wt{\%} Al2O3 and 44–50 wt{\%} SiO2). This compositional range is controlled by two major temperature-sensitive coupled substitutions. Approximately 50{\%} of the total Al variation ({\~{}}0.8 atoms per formula unit = apfu) is due to the edenite exchange [TSi + A□ = TAl + A(Na + K)] and another 25–30{\%} is the consequence of a Ti-Tschermak exchange (TSi + M1–M3 Mn = TAl + M1–M3Ti). In contrast, the pressure-sensitive Al-Tschermak substitution (TSi + M1–M3 Mg = TAl + M1–M3Al) did not play a significant role, as M1–M3Al does not correlate with TAl and is always {\textless}0.2 apfu.In order to constrain the ranges of absolute P and T over which these hornblendes crystallized and to assess the sensitivity of the recent thermo-barometric algorithms of BH1990, HB1994TA (requiring silica saturation), HB1994TB (not requiring silica saturation) and AS1995, we have calculated pressures and temperatures for two selected populations of analyses wherein Al2O3 contents are within analytical error (5.95 to 6.05 wt{\%} Al2O3, N = 78 and 7.7 to 7.8 wt{\%} Al2O3, N = 40). The barometric formulation of AS1995 gives a mean pressure of 2.24 ± 0.05 for the high-Al population at 760 °C, which is indistinguishable from the 2.4 ± 0.5 kbar estimate of Johnson and Rutherford (1989a). A high sensitivity to temperature at low P is suggested by the geologically implausibly shallow depths calculated for the low-Al population ({\textless}1 kbar at 760 °C). The three thermometric formulations give reasonable results between 706 and 814 °C, but the HB1994TA calibration gives a mean temperature higher by {\~{}}50 °C and is more sensitive to small analytical differences ({\~{}}100 °C spread for each population). HB1994TB is considered the most reliable calibration of the Al-in-hornblende thermometer as it most precisely reproduces T estimates determined by independent methods.Nine out of 14 traverses across large phenocrysts from the Fish Canyon magma display rimward increases in TAl, A(Na + K), and M1–M3Ti, compensated by decreases in TSi, and M1–M3Mn. Using the HB1994TB algorithm, the low-Al population, typical of near-core compositions, gives a mean temperature of {\~{}}715 °C, which is {\~{}}35–45 °C above the water-saturated granite solidus at 2–2.5 kbar. The high-Al population, representing the average rim composition, gives a value around 760 °C, which is indistinguishable from independent T determinations using coexisting Fe-Ti oxides and Qtz-Mag oxygen isotope thermometry. These profiles suggest that Fish Canyon hornblendes crystallized during near-isobaric reheating over a temperature range of {\~{}}40 °C, which is consistent with our model of rejuvenation and remobilization of a pre-existing near-solidus crystal mush of batholithic dimensions via shallow intrusion of more mafic magma (Bachmann et al. 2002). Crystallization of hornblende from a high-SiO2, low-MgO melt during reheating requires an open system, in which both heat and mass, in particular volatiles, are transferred from the underlying mafic magma.},

Previously determined ages of {\~{}} 2030-2020 Ma obtained from high-temperature chronometers (zircon, garnet, monazite) are generally thought to provide the best estimate of the peak of Palaeoproterozoic granulite-facies metamorphism in the Central Zone, whereas ages as young as {\~{}} 2006 Ma from late melt patches suggest that temperatures remained above the wet solidus for an extended period. We present a new MC-ICP-MS 207Pb-206Pb age of 2030.9 +/- 1.5 Ma for titanite found in amphibolite- to greenschist-facies alteration zones developed adjacent to quartz vein systems and related pegmatites that cut a strongly deformed Central Zone metabasite. This age could potentially date cooling of rocks at this locality to temperatures below the wet solidus. Alternatively, the titanite could be inherited from the metabasite host, and the age determined from it date the peak of metamorphism. Integration of the geochronology with LA-ICP-MS trace element data for minerals from the metabasite, the hydrothermal vein systems and comparable rocks elsewhere shows that the titanite formed during the amphibolite-facies hydrothermal alteration, not at the metamorphic peak or during the greenschist-facies phase of veining. This suggests that high-grade rocks in the Central Zone have cooled differentially through the wet solidus, and provides timing constraints on when Palaeoproterozoic reworking in the Central Zone began. This study illustrates the potential of combined geochronological and high-resolution geochemical studies to accurately match mineral ages to distinct crustal processes.},

abstract = {Abstract  Chemical diffusion of Zr under anhydrous, pO2-buffered conditions has been measured in natural titanite. The source of diffusant was either zircon powder or a ZrO2–Al2O3–titanite mixture. Experiments were run in sealed silica glass capsules with solid buffers (to buffer at NNO or QFM). Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) was used to measure diffusion profiles. The following Arrhenius parameters were obtained for Zr diffusion parallel to c over the temperature range 753–1,100°C under NNO-buffered conditions: D Zr = 5.33 × 10−7 exp(−325 ± 30 kJ mol−1/RT) m2 s−1 Diffusivities are similar for experiments buffered at QFM. These data suggest that titanite should be moderately retentive of Zr chemical signatures, with diffusivities slower than those for O and Pb in titanite, but faster than those for Sr and the REE. When applied in evaluation of the relative robustness of the recently developed Zr-in-titanite geothermometer (Hayden and Watson, Abstract, 16th V.M. Goldschmidt Conference 2006), these findings suggest that Zr concentrations in titanite will be less likely to be affected by later thermal disturbance than the geothermometer based on Zr concentrations in rutile (Zack et al. in Contrib Mineral Petrol 148:471–488, 2004; Watson et al. in Contrib Mineral. Petrol, 2006), but much less resistant to diffusional alteration subsequent to crystallization than the Ti-in-Zircon geothermometer (Watson and Harrison in Science 308:841–844, 2005).},

There is also a strong positive correlation between Al and F content of these titanites, indicating that the combined substitution is enhanced by the presence of F. Al contents of titanite vary between tectonic units, with the most aluminous varieties occurring in the high-pressure Eclogite Zone. Variations also occur from sample to sample within a single tectonic unit and both between and within individual grains in a single sample. Complex zoning with sharp chemical and optical discontinuities is observed, with Al 2O 3 variations of up to 6 wt.{\%} within a single sample. Individual grains generally have low-Al cores, mantled by high-Al zones and rimmed by low-Al edges.

abstract = {The trace element compositions of aplite dikes in the Sierra Nevada batholith of California differ profoundly from high-silica rhyolites (HSRs) and contradict a genetic connection to them. The aplites are strongly depleted in all middle rare earth elements (REEs), whereas HSRs are strongly depleted only in Eu and enriched in other REEs; the aplites are strongly depleted in Y and variably enriched in Sr, whereas HSRs are enriched in Y and strongly depleted in Sr. Volcanic rocks with the trace element characteristics of these aplites are rare to absent in the geologic record. Aplite REE patterns are likely controlled by titanite, which has large distribution coefficients for REEs, whereas HSRs cannot have equilibrated with titanite. Titanite may crystallize late in dacitic magma and thus HSR may be extracted before titanite saturation is reached; aplites would form after titanite appears, but when the melt percentage is too low and the water content of the melt too high (at fluid saturation) for the magma to ascend without rapid crystallization, thus preventing eruption. HSRs could also form by low-degree partial melting of granodiorite plutons in which titanite melts out early. Alternatively, HSRs may be extracted from silica-rich plutons that lack titanite; leucogranite plutons with REE contents that could be complementary to HSRs are present but uncommon in the Sierra Nevada.},

abstract = {Sphene and zircon are common accessory minerals in metamorphic and igneous rocks of very different composition from many different geological environments. Their essential structural constituents, Ti and Zr, are capable of replacing each other to some degree. In this paper we detail the results of high pressure–temperature experiments as well as analyses of natural sphene crystals that establish a systematic relationship between temperature, pressure and Zr concentration in sphene. Calibrations of the temperature and pressure relationships are presented as a thermobarometer. Synthetic sphene crystals were crystallized in the presence of zircon, quartz and rutile at 1–2.4 GPa and 800–1,000°C from hydrothermal solutions. Crystals were analyzed for Zr by electron microprobe (EMP). The experimental results define a log-linear relationship between equilibrium Zr content (ppm by weight), pressure (GPa) and reciprocal absolute temperature: {\$}{\$} {\{}$\backslash$text{\{}log{\}}{\}}({\{}$\backslash$text{\{}Zr{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}sphene{\}}{\}}{\}}{\}} ,{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}ppm{\}}{\}}) = 10.52( $\backslash$pm 0.10) - $\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}7708( $\backslash$pm 101){\}}{\}} {\{}{\{}T(K){\}}{\}} - 960( $\backslash$pm 10)$\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}P({\{}$\backslash$text{\{}GPa{\}}{\}}){\}}{\}} {\{}{\{}T(K){\}}{\}} - {\{}$\backslash$text{\{}log{\}}{\}}(a{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}TiO{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}} {\}}{\}} ) - $\backslash$log (a{\_}{\{}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$text{\{}SiO{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}} {\}}{\}} ). {\$}{\$}The incorporation of Zr into sphene was found to be rather sensitive to pressure effects and also to the effects of kinetic disequilibrium and growth entrapment that result in sector zoning. The Zr content of sphene is relatively insensitive to the presence of both REEs and F-Al substitutions in sphene. To supplement and test the experimental data, sphenes from seven rocks of well-constrained origin were analyzed for Zr by both EMP and ion microprobe (IMP). The sphene thermobarometer records crystallization temperatures that are consistent with independent thermometry. When applied to natural sphene of unknown origin or growth conditions, this thermobarometer has the potential to estimate temperatures with an approximate uncertainty of ±20°C over the temperature range of interest (600–1,000°C). The Zr-in-sphene thermobarometer can also be used in conjunction with the Zr-in-rutile thermobarometer to estimate both pressure and temperature of crystallization.},

abstract = {Titanites extracted from a 520 +/- 9 Ma syn-orogenic syenite at Otjimbingwe (Damara orogen, Namibia) show shape, colour and U-Pb systematics that vary with position in the syenite relative to a major shear zone. Most titanite fractions from syenite cropping out outside the shear zone are characterized by a medium brown anhedral core overgrown by a pale brown subhedral rim. EMPA and SIMS analyses show that the cores are enriched in Al, Fe and sometimes Na, Mg and Mn but also in REE, Nb and Zr relative to the rim. TIMS U-Pb ages from these titanites gave relatively imprecise 207Pb/206Pb ages between 680 +/- 21 Ma and 695 +/- 20 Ma as well as 570 +/- 8 Ma to 604 +/- 9 Ma mainly due to their low 206Pb/204Pb ratios. Combined Th-U-Pb relationships suggest that these titanites contain a component similar to ca. 715-750 Ma-old titanite populations observed so far only in Neoproterozoic syenites from the northern part of the orogen. Titanites from syenites within the shear zone are dark brown, mostly euhedral to subhedral and display only occasionally a pale brown rim. These titanites show decreasing concentrations of Na, Mg, Al and Fe and increasing concentrations of Mn from core to rim, interpreted to reflect growth zonation. Abundances of MREE, HREE, Y, Nb and Zr are higher in the rim than in the core. 207Pb/206Pb ages obtained on these titanites range from 470 +/- 2 Ma to 538 +/- 3 Ma for most samples. Only the samples with the highest 206Pb/204Pb ratios (between 350 and 230) have U-Pb ages similar to the previously published U-Pb zircon age of 520 +/- 9 Ma from the same complex. Other titanite fractions with lower 206Pb/204Pb ratios have slightly older ages than ca. 520 Ma, indicating some inheritance. Inherited titanite survived multiple metamorphic episodes in the Damara orogen between ca. 750 Ma and 470 Ma and the igneous event that lead to the intrusion of the Otjimbingwe syenite at 520 Ma; these data imply a high closure temperature of U-Pb in titanite of 650-{\textgreater} 700 [degree sign]C consistent with previous studies. Coeval apatite has no apparent inheritance, low 206Pb/204Pb ratios between 55 and 170 and U-Pb ages similar to, or only slightly younger than the U-Pb zircon or titanite age obtained on the titanite fractions with the highest 206Pb/204Pb ratios. Assuming a closure temperature for U-Pb of {\textgreater}= 900 [degree sign]C for zircon, {\~{}} 700 [degree sign]C for titanite and {\~{}} 450 [degree sign]C for apatite, initial fast cooling of the complex can be inferred. Our data demonstrate that titanite can contain multiple age domains, preserving a chronological and chemical record of previous igneous events.},

abstract = {Chemical zoning according to the substitution Al + (OH,F) = Ti + O is a common phenomenon in natural titanite and can be used to reconstruct its growth conditions. We synthesized titanite, which has a zoning pattern similar to that found in natural titanite that grew at the expense of rutile, visible in element distribution maps as a patchy irregular pattern. Run conditions in the system CaO-Al2O3-TiO2-SiO2-NaCl-H2O(-CaF2) were 600 {\{}degrees{\}}C, 0.4 GPa, 1 to 107 days duration. Natural rutile crystals were placed in a perforated Pt-tube within an outer Au-capsule containing wollastonite, {\{}gamma{\}}-Al2O3, optionally powdered CaF2, and a NaCl brine, to simulate conditions, where rutile is transformed into titanite by a hydrous Ca-Si-Al(-F) fluid, driven by a chemical potential gradient between inner and outer capsule. Spontaneous nucleation of titanite is restricted to a small number of crystals on the rutile surface in the inner capsule. Growth proceeds from sparse isolated titanite crystals after 1 day to assemblages of several 100 {\{}micro{\}}m large crystals in a reaction rim in the long-time runs. Titanite is strongly zoned in Al-Ti and shows up to {\~{}}0.5 Al per formula unit (pfu) in experiments containing F; without F, substitution is limited to {\~{}}0.25 Al pfu. The range of the Ti-Al exchange is already large in short run times and the same heterogeneity is observed in long-time runs. The Al-Ti distribution (with and without F) in compositional domains (up to several tens of micrometers) is patchy and irregular. No relation of the zoning with time (core-rim) or preferred growth directions was observed. In the case of fluid-mediated growth, mineral growth zoning represents a disequilibrium at supersaturated conditions. The concentration of Ti in the fluid is likely the limiting factor for titanite growth considering the low solubility compared to that of Al, Ca, and Si. Titanium is not transported in significant amounts into the outer capsule, indicating low mobility, in contrast to Al, Ca, and Si, which are transported into the inner capsule. Assuming buffered Al concentration from dissolution of the Al-source, we speculate that the Ti/Al of the fluid at the precipitation site was controlled by the local Ti concentration, which varies over the distance from the rutile surface to the growing titanite crystal and produces the irregular patchy zoning.},

abstract = {Abstract  The accepted standard state entropy of titanite (sphene) has been questioned in several recent studies, which suggested a revision from the literature value 129.3 ± 0.8 J/mol K to values in the range of 110–120 J/mol K. The heat capacity of titanite was therefore re-measured with a PPMS in the range 5 to 300 K and the standard entropy of titanite was calculated as 127.2 ± 0.2 J/mol K, much closer to the original data than the suggested revisions. Volume parameters for a modified Murgnahan equation of state: V P,T  = V 298° × [1 + a°(T − 298) − 20a°(T − 298)] × [1 – 4P/(K 298 × (1 – 1.5 × 10−4 [T − 298]) + 4P)]1/4 were fit to recent unit cell determinations at elevated pressures and temperatures, yielding the constants V 298° = 5.568 J/bar, a° = 3.1 × 10−5 K−1, and K = 1,100 kbar. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of titanite, −2456.2 kJ/mol ({\&}{\#}8710;H°f = −2598.4 kJ/mol) was calculated from the new entropy and volume data combined with data from experimental reversals on the reaction, titanite + kyanite = anorthite + rutile. This value is 4–11 kJ/mol less negative than that obtained from experimental determinations of the enthalpy of formation, and it is slightly more negative than values given in internally consistent databases. The displacement of most calculated phase equilibria involving titanite is not large except for reactions with small {\&}{\#}8710;S. Re-calculated baric estimates for several metamorphic suites yield pressure differences on the order of 2 kbar in eclogites and 10 kbar for ultra-high pressure titanite-bearing assemblages.},

abstract = {Translucent, dark-coloured titanites from a wide variety of geological environments are commonly partly replaced by very fine-grained aggregates of REE-rich minerals (including allanite, monazite, and bastn{\"{a}}site), rutile, quartz, calcite, apatite, and chlorite along grain fractures and boundaries. The aggregates of REE-rich minerals are bordered by an irregular zone of altered titanite, which, by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), is considerably lower in REEs, U, and Th than the adjacent unaltered matrix. Light REEs and Th are differentially depleted in the altered zone and correspondingly enriched in secondary minerals. Additionally, HREEs and U have been lost to the external system, the loss of HREEs being in proportion to the increase in atomic number. Natural radiation damage was not an important factor in promoting the late alteration of titanite. Titanite which has been subjected to late hydrothermal activity would not remain a closed system in respect to either U or Th decay series and therefore cannot be used for U/Pb and Th/Pb geochronology. The observed leaching and partial dissolution of titanite under hydrothermal conditions are generally consistent with laboratory experimentation, indicating that proper isolation from any communication with hydrothermal fluids is essential in the application of titanite-based ceramics for the immobilization of radioactive waste.},

abstract = {We present detailed experimental results on the partitioning of rare earth elements (REE) between titanite and a range of different silicate melts. Our results show that Henry's law of trace element partitioning depends on bulk composition, the available partners for heterovalent substitution, crystal composition, and melt composition. We illustrate that the partition coefficients for Sm depend very strongly on the bulk concentration of Sm in the system. The substitution mechanism, by which rare earth elements are incorporated into the crystal structure, plays an important role for trace element partitioning and also for the onset of Henry's law. Our data show that there are clear differences between substitution mechanisms of major elements compared to elements which are present only as traces. Our experiments also clearly show that the onset of Henry's law depends on the concentrations of the sum of all trace elements which are incorporated into the crystal by the same substitution mechanism. For geochemical modelling of magmatic processes involving titanite, and indeed other accessory phases, it is of crucial importance to first evaluate whether the REE, and other trace elements, are present as traces or as major elements, only then appropriate D values may be chosen.},

abstract = {A large data set of single and multi-grain zircon and titanite analyses from a sample of the Oligocene Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT), a voluminous ash flow from the San Juan Mountains of Colorado and widely used 40Ar/39Ar geochronological standard, has been used to evaluate the influence of various sources of analytical and geological uncertainty on the calculated age of this tuff by the isotope dilution U-Pb zircon method. Twenty-three single zircon grains and seven small multi-grain fractions of the FCT yield an inverse-variance weighted mean 206Pb/238U date of 28.402 ± 0.023 Ma (2[sigma]; MSWD 0.93) and a slightly older weighted mean 207Pb/235U date of 28.529 ± 0.030 Ma (MSWD 0.74), which are insensitive to common Pb corrections. Initial 230Th disequilibria calculated from a newly measured Th/U = 2.2 for FCT pumice shards indicate Th-deficiency for these zircons; its correction brings the weighted mean 206Pb/238U date to 28.478 ± 0.024 (MSWD 0.97), minimizing the discordance of the FCT zircon analyses. These calculations culminate in Concordia ages (Ludwig, 1998) for the crystallization of the FCT zircons of 28. 476 ± 0.029 Ma (MSWD 1.50) without propagating decay constant errors, or 28.498 ± 0.035 Ma (MSWD 1.03) with propagated decay constant errors. These results are in close agreement with a previous single-grain 206Pb/238U zircon date of 28.41 ± 0.05 Ma for the FCT (Oberli et al., 1990), however they do not corroborate the discordia lower intercept date of 27.52 ± 0.09 put forth by Lanphere and Baadsgard (2001). The 28.476 ± 0.064 Ma Concordia age for FCT zircons (including systematic decay constant errors and uncertainty in Pb/U tracer calibration) is substantially older than all published 40Ar/39Ar sanidine ages, which range from 27.5 to 28.05 Ma (Lanphere and Baadsgaard, 1997; Renne et al. 1998). A lengthy period ({\~{}}400 k.y.) of zircon residence in the magma chamber before eruption is commonly called upon to explain the age discrepancy. However, FCT titanite, which may remain open to Pb diffusive exchange until quenching upon eruption, yield a minimum 230Th-disequilibrium corrected weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 28.395 ± 0.049 Ma (± 0.078 with tracer uncertainty), weakening residence time arguments, and supporting recent calls for re-evaluation of the 40K decay constant and the accepted ages for commonly used 40Ar/39Ar mineral standards. The FCT zircon Concordia age also provides an empirical constraint on the decay constants of the U isotopes, indicating the relative accuracy of the currently accepted decay constants to within the original counting statistic errors of Jaffey et al. (1971).},

abstract = {Titanite/liquid partition coefficients for most of the trace elements relevant in petrogenetic studies are provided for titanite-saturated liquids equilibrated at 1.5 GPa and 850 °C starting from lamproitic compositions. The high compatibility observed for REE, HFSE, Sr, V and Sc, and the strong incompatibility observed for actinides, large ion lithophile and light elements are discussed in terms of available crystal-chemical mechanisms for incorporation and crystal-structure control. The exchange vectors Na1Ca-1 and Al1Ti-1 allow local charge balance to be achieved after incorporation of REE3+ and R5+ at the Ca and Ti site, respectively. The significant amounts of H measured are also relevant in this regard [the exchange mechanism being (OH)1O-1 at the O1 site]. The incorporation of U4+ and Th4+ at the Ca site is scarce, and is likely balanced by that of Mg2+ at the Ti site; both these substitutions are responsible for strong structural strain. Titanite can thus be considered an important repository for REE and HFSE in metamorphic and igneous rocks, and its role must be accounted for when modelling trace-element residence during metamorphic reactions and late magmatic crystallisation history. Due to the measured differences in compatibility, titanite crystallisation increases the values of Nb/Ta and LREE/HREE ratios in residual liquids. The similar compatibility of U and Pb makes titanite suitable for U-Pb geochronology of igneous rocks only after common Pb correction. Finally, this study confirms that the titanite end member is not suitable for radioactive waste disposal due to the discussed crystal-chemical constraints, and that titanite-based waste forms should contain high amounts of Na+ and Mg2+.},

This compositional variability of titanite could be used in phase equilibrium calculations, if the activity-composition relations in (Al + F)-bearing titanites were sufficiently known. Experimental investigations by Troitzsch and Ellis ([Troitzsch, U. and Ellis, D.J. (2002) Thermodynamic properties and stability of AlF-bearing titanite CaTiOSiO4-CaAlFSiO4.

Journal of Petrology 43, 1787-1814.) derived non-ideal-mixing models for solid solutions along the join CaTiSiO4O-CaAlSiO4F. Tropper et al. [Troitzsch, U. and Ellis, D.J. (2002) Thermodynamic properties and stability of AlF-bearing titanite CaTiOSiO4-CaAlFSiO4. Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology, 142, 543-563] derived a preliminary regular model in the T range 900-1100 °C, in which the T-dependent interaction parameter, WG, was negative. In contrast, Troitzsch and Ellis ([Troitzsch, U. and Ellis, D.J. (2002) Thermodynamic properties and stability of AlF-bearing titanite CaTiOSiO4-CaAlFSiO4. Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology, 142, 543-563]) favored a regular activity model with positive WG. The different signs of the interaction parameter strongly influence calculated non-ideal titanite activities. Comparing available simple ideal ionic (coupled-ionic, non-coupled-ionic) activity models with the non-ideal models shows that aCaTiSiO4O, calculated with the ideal ionic models is substantially lower at almost all T. Calculation of two suitable titanite-rutile-involving equilibria for thermobarometry applied to literature data from rocks from four UHP terranes shows that ideal ionic models yield the best convergence with independently established P estimates. Although the literature data have to be treated with caution (e.g. retrogression, compositional disequilibrium etc.), the calculations nonetheless indicate that in terms of T estimates, high-Al (XAl {\textgreater} 0.5) titanites yield a large variation of up to 300 °C in T and low-Al (XAl {\textless} 0.2) titanites yield the best convergence with independently established T estimates. This study shows that P and T estimates derived from ideal models and experimentally constrained non-ideal models for titanite activity may show large deviations at UHP conditions, ranging from 0.05 to 3.0 GPa and up to 300 °C. Therefore the current status of titanite-rutile-involving thermobarometry allows it only to be applied to Al-rich (XAl {\textgreater} 0.2) titanites from UHP rocks if independent, more robust P-T estimates are available. Until better activity constraints are available, it is recommended that the user employ either the ideal coupled-ionic model for titanite solid solutions involving mixing on the Ti and the O1-site and compare the results to an experimentally derived activity model, or adopt a range of different activity models (ionic and regular) to obtain a range of P-T conditions.},

abstract = {The Qitianling granite, which is located in Hunan Province (southern China), is a metaluminous Sn granite that crystallized at relatively oxidized conditions, between the Ni-NiO (NNO) and Fe2O3-Fe3O4 (MH) buffers. Titanite (sphene, CaTiSiO5) is a common tin-carrier mineral in the Qitianling granite. Based on electron-microprobe (EMP) and multi-collector (MC)-Laser-ablation (LA)-ICPMS investigations, we describe three types of titanite with various textures and SnO2 contents, which probably formed during the magmatic and hydrothermal processes responsible for the granite crystallization and later evolution. The form of type I titanite ranges from subhedral to euhedral coarse-grained crystals and typically exhibits an envelope-like shape and sector-zoning. It is characterized by a high Fe2O3 content (on average 2.44 wt.{\%}) and low SnO2 (0.43 wt.{\%}), which indicates crystallization during an early magmatic stage. Its formation temperature is estimated to have been 721 to 780 °C from EMP- and LA-ICPMS using the Zr-in-titanite geothermometer. Type II titanite occurs as both discrete grains and symplectitic intergrowths; and typically fills interstices between other minerals. It contains up to 26 wt.{\%} SnO2, which suggests a late magmatic origin. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns for type II titanite reveal a lanthanide tetrad effect that was linked to differentiation of the granite magma. Type III titanite is restricted to cleavage cracks in chlorite and is rich in Al2O3. It is obviously the secondary product of biotite alteration at a temperature that is estimated to be lower than 400 °C during the hydrothermal stage. This hydrothermal activity also impacted the primary titanites. Type I titanite experienced alteration to different degrees via coupled dissolution-reprecipitation, which gave rise to the formation of secondary minerals including cassiterite micro-grains. Some grains of the type II titanite reacted with fluids along the grain boundary, which led to the gradual leaching of Sn. Based on information from these types of titanite and their Sn behavior, we discuss the progressive enrichment of Sn during and after granite crystallization under a high oxidation state as well as the predominant role of fluids in the leaching, concentration and transportation of Sn during hydrothermal processes, which favors vein-type Sn mineralization.},

abstract = {High pressure, high temperature phase equilibria experiments were performed to investigate the effect of TiO2 on mineral-liquid equilibria for near natural olivine + orthopyroxene-saturated mafic liquids. At 1.2 GPa and 1360°C, and at 2.8 GPa and 1530°C, near-natural picritic basaltic liquids with TiO2 concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 22 wt.{\%} were forced to be in equilibrium with olivine (ol) + orthopyroxene (opx) by adding appropriate quantities of San Carlos olivine with increasing TiO2. Titanium enrichment of the ol + opx saturated mafic liquids results in nearly pressure-independent linear decreases in SiO2 amounting to 0.60 ± 0.04 and 0.56 ± 0.05 wt.{\%} SiO2 per wt.{\%} TiO2 at 1.2 and 2.8 GPa, respectively. Olivine-liquid Fe-Mg KD decreases at 1.2 GPa from 0.33 at 0.4 wt.{\%} TiO2 down to 0.22 at 19 wt.{\%} TiO2. A similar trend, shifted to slightly higher KD values, is observed at 2.8 GPa. With increasing TiO2, the activity coefficient of SiO2 in the liquid increases owing to association of networking-modifying cations with Ti4+. Consequently, a smaller mole fraction of SiO2, XSiO2Liq, is required to maintain the silica activity imposed by the coexistence of olivine and orthopyroxene. Strong association between Ti and Fe in the liquid reduces aFeOLiq and [gamma]FeOLiq, thereby causing olivine-liquid Fe-Mg KD to decrease. These effects are expected to result in small decreases in SiO2 and very small increases in FeO in TiO2-enriched mantle-derived sources, such as those in OIB source regions derived from small degrees of melting of peridotite at high pressure. Stronger effects on the compositions of low-degree partial melts of more titanium-enriched rocks, such as pyroxenites, may be expected. Solubility of TiO2 in olivine under magmatic conditions and at modest (1.2-2.8 GPa) pressure is near 0.2 wt.{\%}. For TiO2, partitioning between olivine and liquid is Henrian over the range of compositions studied, indicating constant activity coefficients for liquids between 0-20 wt.{\%} TiO2 and for olivine between 0-0.23 wt.{\%}. Orthopyroxene/liquid partitioning of TiO2 is variable, presumably owing to complex interactions between Al and Ti in orthopyroxene. Olivine/liquid partitioning of Al2O3 is nearly constant, but partitioning of Al2O3 between orthopyroxene and liquid is variable, owing to the aforementioned interactions between Al and Ti. Olivine/liquid and orthopyroxene/liquid partitioning of CaO diminish with increasing TiO2, suggesting stabilization of CaO in silicate liquids by formation of CaO-TiO2 complexes. At 1.2 GPa, saturation in aluminous armalcolite is found for liquids at 19.2 wt.{\%} TiO2, in contrast, at 2.8 GPa, Ti-rich oxide saturation is not encountered for liquids with as much as 21.8 wt.{\%} TiO2. The large TiO2 enrichment in the liquid required for oxide saturation in the presence of olivine + orthopyroxene at these pressures suggests that near-solidus liquids generated by melting of Ti-rich oxide-bearing peridotite would have {\textgreater}=20 wt.{\%} TiO2. The general absence of such Ti-rich primitive terrestrial lavas either precludes magmas from such source assemblages or indicates that they are strongly diluted by other magmas. Our results also suggest that armalcolite may be a significant phase in the Ti-enriched portions of the lunar mantle.},

abstract = {For iron-rich compositions, reactions among titanite, clinopyroxene, olivine, quartz, magnetite, and ilmenite can constrain the conditions under which common rocks form. Phase equilibrium experiments in the system CaO-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -TiO 2 -SiO 2 constrain two of these reactions: (1) clinopyroxene + ilmenite = titanite + olivine and (2) clinopyroxene + ilmenite = titanite + magnetite+quartz, in the range 600-1100 degrees C and O2 conditions. The experimental results indicate that the assemblage clinopyroxene-ilmenite represents reducing conditions relative to titanite-magnetite-quartz. However, the latter is not necessarily indicative of oxygen fugacity conditions higher than that of the FMQ buffer. The data also strongly suggest that the equilibrium positions of reaction 1 and 2 reflect changes in pressure, temperature, f O2 a SiO2 mu Fe (super 2+) Ti (super 4+) Fe (super 3+) (sub -2) and mu CaFe (sub -1) in the coexisting Fe-Ti oxides and silicates. Standard state thermodynamic data and solution models for Ca-Fe olivine and clinopyroxene solid solutions. Fe-Ti ilmenite and magnetite solid solutions, and quartz (QUILF database) allow refinement of standard state thermochemical data for end-member titanite (A2/a space group): Delta H 0 = -2607.41 kj/mol; S 0 = 106.00 J/(mol.K); Delta G 0 = -2458.95 kJ/mol and require modification of published heat capacity equations to: C p = 591460608/T 3 -5118324/T 2 -1038.4/T + 247.47. The derived data for titanite are internally consistent with an enthalpy of formation of -2610.13+ or -2.90 (2 std. error) kJ/mol. established by drop solution calorimetry, and are specific to the QUILF database. However, analysis of the experimental results using different internally consistent databases suggest that the revision proposed in this study of the currently accepted entropy value of 129.20 J/(mol-K) is largely independent of the databases used. The new entropy is required by the enthalpy of formation for titanite adopted here, which may also require revision of the heat capacity.},

abstract = {Critical evaluation of the thermodynamic data for titanite, in conjunction with a heat capacity equation that takes into account the P21/a {\{}leftrightarrow{\}} A2/a transition and a more complete P-V-T data set for titanite, indicates that: (1) enthalpy of formation values greater than -2600 kJ/mol are not supported by calorimetry; (2) calculated internally consistent feasible solutions converge to enthalpy of formation from the elements values between -2608 and -2600 kJ/mol and 113 to 121 J/mol{\{}middle dot{\}}K for the entropy; (3) the practice of adjusting the enthalpy of formation to fit phase equilibrium experiments may be erroneous, in contrast, it is the currently accepted entropy of 129.20 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.84 J/mol{\{}middle dot{\}}K that may need revision to a smaller value. Consequently, we optimize standard-state properties for end-member titanite (P21/a structure) consistent with the thermodynamic data in the program QUILF. In addition, we use a modified version of the program to calibrate equilibria among titanite (CaTiOSiO4), Fe-Mg-Ti ilmenite and spinel, Ca-Mg-Fe pyroxenes and olivine, and quartz. Calculations at 1 and 3 kbar, and 650, 850, and 1100 {\{}degrees{\}}C, in the system CaO-MgO-FeO-Fe2O3-TiO2-SiO2, suggest that the [IMG] fd1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} and [IMG] fd2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} impose well defined fO2, aSiO2, and XFeOpx restrictions to the assemblages (1) titanite + spinel phase + quartz, (2) titanite + orthopyroxene, (3) augite + ilmenite, and consequently titanite stability. The absence of quartz (aSiO2{\textless} 1 with respect to Qz) favors the sub-assemblage Fe-Mg-Ti spinel + titanite over augite + ilmenite, and the latter over titanite + orthopyroxene. Nonetheless, in the absence of quartz, no titanite-bearing assemblage is stable relative to olivine + orthopyroxene + augite + ilmenite + Fe-Mg-Ti spinel. From the phase relations, we can also infer that in quartz-saturated rocks: (1) titanite can coexist with orthopyroxene only at low XFeOpx values, regardless of fO2 conditions, whereas the assemblage titanite + orthopyroxene + spinel phase requires high fO2, relative Mg-enrichment (from high to moderate XFeOpx), and temperatures [{\&}le;]650 {\{}degrees{\}}C. (2) The association of titanite with a spinel phase is generally indicative of relatively oxidizing conditions. (3) The assemblage titanite + olivine requires fO2 condition close to FMQ and relative Fe-enrichment (from moderate to high XFeOpx), and temperatures [{\&}le;]650 {\{}degrees{\}}C.},

abstract = {In the system CaO-MgO-FeO-Fe2O3-TiO2-SiO2, equilibria among titanite, pyroxene(s), olivine,spinel phase, ilmenite, and quartz constrain fO2, T, aSiO2, aTiO2, aFe, and the compositional variables, {\{}micro{\}} TiFe2+Fe-23+ {\{}micro{\}}C a(Mg,Fe)-1, and consequently {\{}micro{\}}Mg,Fe-1 among the silicate and oxide phases. These equilibria can provide the framework for a better understanding of relevant titanite-bearing natural assemblages. In addition, such equilibria can constrain the variables that operate during crystallization of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Titanite-bearing assemblages with pyroxene(s), Fe-Mg-Ti ilmenite and spinel, olivine, and quartz are rare in metamorphic rocks but are common in igneous rocks where they are more commonly reported in plutonic than in volcanic rocks. Probably because, at high temperatures, titanite cannot coexist with the relative common in volcanic rocks sub-assemblage augite + orthopyroxene + olivine + spinel phase + ilmenite. Moreover, decreasing pressure and temperature conditions appear to favor titanite. Thus, it is not surprising that titanite is commonly observed in slowly cooled rocks, albeit, most typically in association with amphibole. We argue that the titanite + amphibole association is favored by high aH2O and, because aH2O typically increases during crystallization of a pluton, titanite + amphibole (and consequently titanite) is more common in plutonic than in volcanic rocks. We have used a modified version of the program QUILF that includes our thermodynamic data for titanite and appropriate titanite-bearing assemblages to estimate the equilibrium crystallization conditions of samples from: (1) a tonalite from the Myoken-Zan granitic complex in Japan; (2) the Sandwich Horizon in the Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland; (3) rhyodacites, dacites, and andesites from the Sajama, Porquesa, and Parinacota volcanoes in the Andes; (4) the Fish Canyon Tuff in Colorado; and (5) a quartz-rich, calc-silicate gneiss adjacent to the Horse Creek Anorthosite Complex in Wyoming. The calculations suggest that: (1) these titanite-bearing assemblages crystallized at values of fO2 that ranged from slightly below FMQ to more than 3 logfO2 units above FMQ at 500-800 {\{}degrees{\}}C; and (2) the stability of titanite is controlled by T, fO2, a SiO2, and the compositions of the coexisting oxides and silicates.},
